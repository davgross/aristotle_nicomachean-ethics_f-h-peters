The argument is, in fact, “I ought not, therefore I can not (am able not to do it),”⁠—like Kant’s, “I ought, therefore I can.” But, if valid at all, it is valid universally, and the conclusion should be that the body only can be compelled, and not the will⁠—that a compulsory act is impossible. <a href="book-3.xhtml#noteref-36" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The point to be illustrated is, that in these private transactions what one man gains is equal to what the other loses, so that the penalty that will restore the balance can be exactly measured.

This paragraph occurs again in the next chapter (<a href="book-5.xhtml#c5n9">5</a>⁠—“This is no less true of the other arts and professions …”): but it can hardly have come into this place by accident; we rather see the author’s thought growing as he writes.

					<p>This section seems to me not an alternative to the first paragraph of this chapter; but a correction of it, or rather a remark to the effect that the whole passage (both the first paragraph and the discussion introduced by it) ought to be rewritten, and an indication of the way in which this should be done. Of considerable portions of the Nicomachean Ethics we may safely say that the author could not have regarded them as finished in the form in which we have them. It is possible that the author made a rough draft of the whole work, or of the several parts of it, which he kept by him and worked upon⁠—working some parts up to completion; sometimes rewriting a passage without striking out the original version, or even indicating which was to be retained (<abbr class="initialism">e.g.</abbr> the theory of pleasure); more frequently adding an afterthought which required the rewriting of a whole passage, without rewriting it (<abbr class="initialism">e.g.</abbr>, to take one instance out of many in Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>, <i xml:lang="grc">τὸ ἀντιπεπονθός</i> is an afterthought which strictly requires that the whole book should be rewritten); sometimes (as here) making a note of the way in which a passage should be rewritten.
